# Item-Catalog-Project-4---FSND---Udacity
======

### Project Overview
> An application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

### Why I made this Project?
> Modern web applications perform a variety of functions and provide amazing features and utilities to their users. But deep down, itâ€™s really all just **CRUD creating, reading, updating and deleting data**. In this project, I am combining knowledge of building dynamic websites with persistent data storage to create a web application that provides a compelling service to the users.

### What I have Learned?
> I have learned to develop a RESTful web application using the **Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication**. I have also learned when to properly use the various available HTTP methods and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.
